# Decorators
- a function that accepts a function as input, and returns a modified function as output

- the first thing that confuses people about decorators is a function that returns a function

- decorators are possible in python because python has FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS, functions are FIRST CLASS citizens in python.
if a programming language supports first-class functions, that means you can put a function anywhere you could put any other value. 

- instance methods are functions that belong to objects, INSTANCES of our class
