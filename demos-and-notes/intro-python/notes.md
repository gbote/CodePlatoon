# Intro to Python


## types

- numbers
    - we can manipulate numbers using arithmetic operators +,-,*,/,%
    - there is no === !==, only == !=. python will not perform type coercion if you compare values of different types


- strings
'string'
"another string"
"""
multiline
"""

- booleans
True, False


- list. an ordered list of values. roughly equivalent to an array in javascript.
a_list = [1,2,3]

- tuple. 
    - a tuple is immutable. this means that it cannot be mutated. it cannot be changed, modified, etc.
a_tuple = (1,2,3)


- Dictionary
    - roughly equivalent to an object in javascript, a set of key-value pairs
    - note that python also has a data structure called an 'object', which is different

- functions
    - defined using `def`
    - body must be indented, because python is whitespace sensitive
