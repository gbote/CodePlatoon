# React Workshop

## Functional vs Class Components
- A function is a react component because:
    - It accepts an argument named "props" (which is usually a JS object)
    - It returns a React Element
    - It is a normal JS function
    - Functional components are preferred - start

- Class Component
    - Is defined using a JS class that extends React.Component
    - It has a method called "render" which returns a React Element
    - Class components can use more of the React lifecycle than functional components
