# OOP Inheritance in Python

We can use inheritance in our programs to help us write less code.

- inheritance is a relationship between two classes, a parent class (super class) and a child class (subclass)
- inheritance helps us model relationships where one class is a subtype of another class
- a dog is an animal. all dogs are animals, but not all animals are dogs.
