# Object Oriented Programming

python is an OOP language, meaning everything (booleans, strings, lists, integers)

objects have ATTRIBUTES and METHODS
an object is a NOUN, it has ATTRIBUTES which are either ADJECTIVES describing what hte object is, 
or NOUNS, describing what the object HAS
an object also can have METHODS, which are VERBS that describe what the object can do. 


objects are organized by CLASSes, which is a type of a thing, or a blueprint for a thing. 
Dog, Person, Rectangle, might be examples of classes. any type of thing that we might have multiple INSTANCES of, could be a class.


common benefits of OOP:
Encapsulation: using OOP, we can restrict where data is accessible. 
Abstraction: hiding the complexity of our program in other modules/methods. creating simpler ideas to represent multiple, more complex ideas, so that our program is easier to think about. 
Inheritance: a feature of OOP that enables multiple similar classes to share attributes, and avoid repeating code
Polymorphism: methods can behave differently depending on the type of object that is passed in.


the first method that every class needs is `__init__()`
